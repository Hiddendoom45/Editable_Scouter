<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What to Do in Teleop</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What to watch for in teleop is primarily the defences the team crosses, and from which direction, and the goals that they score.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When a team crosses a defence press the corresponding button on the list of defences near the bottom left of the game panel, if it’s the drawbridge or sally port that they cross note which direction they cross and whether they just push it open and go back through or they actually have a mechanism to open/close the gates in the comment box.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When a team even attempts a shot note whether they fail/succeed the high/low goal by pressing one of the scoring buttons, with he succeed ones just being high goal/low goal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other things you should watch for is how well the robot driver is, how easily can they align themselves to cross defences, navigate through obstacles and robots, how well they can align for shooting etc. If they have a really bad driver(in comparison to the other robots) click the bad driver button and state why in the comment box. If they get stuck, just note it in the comment box(no need to click bad driver button).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All other things in the faults category are pretty self explanatory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the last minutes section press tower challenge if the robot has gotten onto the ramps surrounding the tower so that its wheels are no longer touching the carpets by the end of the game but doesn’t manage to scale the tower. Press scale Tower if the robot manages to scale the tower such that the bottom of the robot is above the bottom of the low goal(if it’s close it still counts, unless you hear the referee say that it doesn’t)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After game is done go onto the scoring tab.</span></p>
